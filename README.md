dotfiles
========

It's dangerous to go alone. Take these.

This repository is a collection of so-called "dotfiles" we use at
[space150](http://space150com). Much of it is copied or inspired by the work of
the great folks at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com).

## Installing

Clone this repo, then from that directory:

```sh
brew bundle
rcup -x README.md -x Brewfile
```

You can refer to the excellent docs thoughtbot has in [it's dotfiles
repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) for more info.
